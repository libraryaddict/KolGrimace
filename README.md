This is a script intended for Kingdom of Loathing to provide information about when is an ideal time to farm for maps and how long you have left, as well as use said maps.
It can also tell you the chances of meeting an alien today and in the next several days if you don't want to wait for an alien free day.

This script does not farm maps itself.

There is another script, not made by me, that does farm maps. You can check it out, though I don't use it and have not tried it.

https://github.com/horrible-little-slime/garfo

## To install the script, use

```text
git checkout libraryaddict/KolGrimace release
```

To use this script, there are two parameters you can provide.

Command usage is

`grimace`

or

`grimace <Param>`

## Parameters

`info` - This is the default parameter, and does not need to be provided.

This will look at your pills and tell you if you need to go grimace map farming, if today is a good day, and when the next good days are.

Reminder, grimace map farming isn't always a good idea because it highly depends on the current moons of loathing. On certain days, only monsters that drop maps will spawn. On other days, aliens that drop trash will spawn.

This lets you know when a good day is.

`maps`

This will use as many transponders as appropiate and use your grimace maps to collect the distension pills, and dog pills. It will attempt to balance the distribution so you end up with an equal amount of both pills.

This is recommended to be run when overdrunk, and as such will currently fail to run when in headless mode. And will require confirmation to continue if not in headless mode.

If you're overdrunk, then it will not require confirmation.
This is because there's no advantages that I can think of, to be gained by using this when not overdrunk.
